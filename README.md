A controller to peripheral program

So what am I? I am a program that will allow you to use that handy controller as a Keyboard/Mouse combo! Please note; this is intended for lazy people sitting on a couch or leaning back in a chair!

Now that we have that cleared up, let's get down to the good stuff.

First thing you'll notice is a nice little window that says "Game Mode" and "Peripheral Device"
When game mode is enabled, your controller functions as if you have never seen this program in your life!
Alternatively, when peripheral mode is enabled you can use that same controller as a mouse/keyboard combo!

The neat thing is while in game mode you can press Select+Start together and it will enable peripheral mode.
You can also press this again to enable game mode. Please note there is a 5 second delay from when you enable either mode.
That you can use your controller as a mouse/keyboard combo..
What this means is after enabling peripheral mode you can't move your mouse or send a command until 5 seconds has passed.

Now that we know how to enable both modes, let's talk about the keys.
Nevermind, talking is too tiresome, just check out the picture above breaks down what each does.
You can also find this image in the programs Image folder under KeyMap.png

When you switch between modes a quick 1 second sound will play.
You can use your own sound for the switching of game modes if you desire.
Just delete or rename the file labeled "Default" and save yours as "Default".

Well, that's all I really have for you. If you run into any programs or your controller is a
super-special awesome one that this doesn't work with then please email me at Tf2Prophete@gmail.com.

Also, if you have a game that uses both Select+Start (I assume there MIGHT be one out there) let me know and I can change the command for you.
